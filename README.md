# Campus Life Starter 

This is my completed version of the **Campus Life** website project for the CodePath SITE Program (Summer 2025). The goal of this lab was to build a fully responsive and accessible single-page site that showcases student organizations, events, and campus news using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- **Semantic HTML**: Clear structure using `<section>`, `<article>`, and proper heading levels.
- **Custom Styling**: 
  - Font families, sizes, and color schemes using CSS and Google Fonts.
  - Color palette chosen with accessibility and contrast in mind.
- **Box Model**: Thoughtful use of margins, padding, and borders to create clean visual spacing.
- **Flexbox Layout**: Responsive alignment and layout of navigation, section content, and images.
- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Media queries adapt layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
  - Navigation and sections stack gracefully on small screens.
- **Interactive Elements**: 
  - Pseudo-classes like `:hover` for dynamic navigation and link interactions.
  - Transitions for smooth visual feedback.
- **Stretch Goals Implemented**:
  - Hover effects and link transitions.
  - Attribute selectors and hover-based child selectors.
  - Clean, accessible layout design.
